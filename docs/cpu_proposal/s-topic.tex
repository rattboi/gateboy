\section{Project Focus}
Our project will focus on the CPU core of a gameboy using a previous project,
FPGABOY \footnote{FPGABOY - an implementation of a gameboy system onto an FPGA 
writen in Verilog}. Another team will be focusing on peripherals for our project 
so that they can operate as a complete system. The CPU core, originally writen 
in Verilog, will be ported to use a synthesizable subset of System Verilog.
The synthesis target we will be focusing on will be on an Altera Cyclone II 
FPGA kit available in FAB 60-04\footnote{Part Number DK-CYCII-2C20N}.

Testing will use two modes from the Veloce Solo tools; the synthesizeable testbench and the TBX modes.
