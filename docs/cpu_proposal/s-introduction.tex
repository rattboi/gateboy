\section{Introduction}

The Nintendo Gameboy, the first popular portable gaming console, used a custom processor, the Sharp LR35902, clocked at 4.19MHz.  This CISC processor is essentially an improved Intel 8080, with some additional features from the Zilog Z80.  None of the registers introduced in the Z80 are present, but many instruction set enhancements (particularly bit manipulation) introduced with the Z80 are available.  Additionally, the LR35902 has no IN/OUT instructions, instead I/O ports are accessed directly by normal LD instructions and the sign and parity/overflow flags have been removed.
