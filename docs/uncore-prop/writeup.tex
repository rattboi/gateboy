\section{Overview}
We plan on implementing the sprite-based graphics of the original
gameboy. The gameboy used raster graphics accessed through a simple,
memory mapped interface. We plan on creating an implmentation of these
graphics, and leveraging the new validation features of System Verilog
to accelerate the testing process. 

\section{Existing Work}
The internet is full of gameboy emulators. In addition, several
emulators have been created for FPGAs (i.e.
\url{https://github.com/trun/fpgaboy}). However, none of these designs
use System Verilog. We plan on using these designs as a jumping-off
point for our own implmentation.

While there is no publicly released design documentation for the 
Gameboy there are a number of resources created by hobbyists who 
have reverse engineered the Gameboy hardware and software.

\section{Requirements}

We plan on implementing the original gameboy's sprite-based raster
graphics engine. In addition to accepting draw commands from the
gameboy cpu, the graphics engine needs to provide interrupt signals to
the CPU. 

The graphics module will be implemented and tested in isolation, 
but we plan to integrate our module with another group's Gameboy CPU 
implementation if time allows.
