\section{Overview}
We plan on implementing the sprite-based graphics used on
the original Gameboy. The Gameboy used raster graphics
accessed through a simple memory mapped interface. We
plan on implementing this graphics module and also
leverage the validation features of System Verilog to 
accelerate the testing process.

\section{Existing Work}
The internet is full of Gameboy emulators. In addition, several
emulators have been created for FPGAs (e.g.
\url{https://github.com/trun/fpgaboy}). However, none of these designs
use System Verilog. We plan on using these designs as a jumping-off
point for our own implementation.

While there is no publicly released design documentation for the 
Gameboy there are a number of resources created by hobbyists who 
have reverse engineered the Gameboy hardware and software.

\section{Requirements}

We plan on implementing the original Gameboy's sprite-based raster
graphics engine. In addition to accepting draw commands from the
Gameboy cpu, the graphics engine needs to provide interrupt signals to
the CPU. 

The graphics module will be implemented and tested in isolation, 
but we plan to integrate our module with another group's Gameboy CPU 
implementation if time allows.  In addition, we plan to synthesize
the full design on an Altera Cyclone II if time allows.
For video output this may include writing a module to convert our 
video output to VGA.


\section{Testing Methodology}
The testing will be implemented with the transaction based
emulation mode on the Veloce hardware emulator. Since the 
actual Gameboy specifications are closed source, the test 
bench will verify the behavior of the graphics module as
described in the documentation from the Existing Work 
section.
